Whats the deal? Yesterday with Nicole wasnt bad just nothing. And it hardly is anything! Walked in tired yesterday. 
Was a bit all over the place. Didn't expect to see Nicole here yesterday! Was a bit taken aback. Thought
she was away for a week! Anyway I walked in Nicole was over the counter and Daryl said good morning. 
I walked up to the front of the counter. Nicole was wearing her hair up and her new t-shirt. Think
Nicole was wearing some sort of eyeliner too. Maybe she always does. We said good morning. Nicole asked if I 
was paying cash or card and I never pay cash. Don't think she ever asks that. Maybe looking for a reason to 
talk. We definitely had a small moment on Thursday. Think thats why I was excited about seeing her. Maybe got a bit carried away
yesterday. Caught her eye a few times yesterday. Maybe she does know now, maybe she doesn't. Just think the way it ended yesterday
may have been what put me down. Nicole was serving the regulars. Think its her Dad. Nicole didn't really speak to him either yesterday. 
May have been just one of those days. Anyway I was talking to Daryl as he had asked me on Saturday to watch his film. 
So yesterday I gave him my email. Anyway, Nicole was serving her regulars and she was trying to get Daryl's attention. Maybe it was an order
or something she couldnt wait to talk about. I said goodbye and dont think she said it back. Again not sure if she did! 

I always overthink things. This just shows it. We caught each others eye yesterday still. Really need to get on with it and just ask her.  
It wont be that bad. Just need to catch her in the morning when its quiet. Overthinking is not going to help this situation. Its 
not a big deal.
